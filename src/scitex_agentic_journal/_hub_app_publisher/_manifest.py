"""Manifest metadata the user-published wrapper hands to ``scitex-hub app submit``.

Per proj-scitex-hub's spec (ADR-0002 + the publishing flow on
``scitex-hub`` develop, see ``src/scitex_hub/_cli/_app/_scaffold.py``
and ``apps_app/views/api_registry.py::api_submit_jwt``), an upstream
Django app published to the hub registry carries the following
manifest shape. We co-locate it here so the published wrapper
(``scitex_agentic_journal_hub_app``) does not invent its own
version-coupled metadata.

The constants are the SOURCE OF TRUTH for the published-app shape; if
the wrapper publishes a different name / version / mount path, those
need updating here too.
